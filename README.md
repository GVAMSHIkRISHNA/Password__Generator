# Password__Generator.py


This project is a Python password generator. It takes two inputs from the user: the purpose of the password and the length of the password. It then generates a random password of the specified length using the pass_chars string, which contains all the lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is then printed to the console and saved to a file called Passwords.txt.

The project is designed to help users generate strong passwords that are difficult to guess. The password generator uses a random number generator to select characters from the pass_chars string, so the passwords are always different. The passwords are also saved to a file, so they can be easily reused.


DETAILED EXPLANATION 


import random              
from time import sleep      

# This line pauses the program for 2 seconds to give the user time to read the instructions.
sleep(2)

# This string contains all the lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters that can be used in the password.
pass_chars = '''abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789~!@#$%^&*()_+}{|:>?<,./}'''

# This line asks the user for the purpose of the password.
purpose = input("For which website/app you need password: ")

# This line asks the user for the length of the password.
length = int(input("Enter the lenght of password you want: "))

# This line creates a blank string to store the password.
password = ""

# This loop generates the password character by character.
for i in range(length):

    # This line randomly selects a character from the pass_chars string.
    char = random.choice(pass_chars)

    # This line appends the randomly selected character to the password string.
    password += char

# This line prints the password to the console.
print(f"\nThe password for {purpose} is : \n{password}\n")

# This line opens the Passwords.txt file in append mode.
with open("Passwords.txt", "a") as file:

    # This line writes the password to the file.
    file.write(f"\n\nThe password for {purpose} is : \n{password}\n\n")

# This line prints a message to the console indicating that the passwords have been saved to the file.
print("The passwords are strored in passwords.txt file")

# This line pauses the program for 10 seconds.
sleep(10)
