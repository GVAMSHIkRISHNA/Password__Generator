# Password__Generator.py


This project is a Python password generator. It takes two inputs from the user: the purpose of the password and the length of the password. It then generates a random password of the specified length using the pass_chars string, which contains all the lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is then printed to the console and saved to a file called Passwords.txt.

The project is designed to help users generate strong passwords that are difficult to guess. The password generator uses a random number generator to select characters from the pass_chars string, so the passwords are always different. The passwords are also saved to a file, so they can be easily reused.
